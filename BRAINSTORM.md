Brainstorm
===============

## Simple series

- Number of polls/time, perhaps grouped on utskott
- Member vote absence/time, also per party


## More complicated

- Co-voting network
  - Per year, quarter, 4-year
  - Condition on utskott
  - On party level (say party vote = 90% level of member vote)
- Make timeline of chair occupancy over time, who sits on which chair in 'kammaren' when?
  - partly to make sure data is consistent..
